 - Algorithm is a set of steps or instructions for completing a task
 - Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.
 - Clearly defined problem statement, input and output
 - The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order
 - The steps also need to be distinct
 - The algorithm should produce a result
 - The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time (Not infinite)
